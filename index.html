    <h1>DisasterConnect</h1>
    <p>Not just surviving disasters‚Äîbut building resilience, dignity, and security for all.<br>For you, for me, and for our communities.</p>

    <h2>üåé Why DisasterConnect Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Climate disasters are intensifying worldwide, with devastating impacts reaching from the global scale to daily life. The cruel irony is that those who contribute the least to climate change often suffer its worst consequences. The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/" target="_blank">IPCC</a> warns that vulnerable populations disproportionately face losses in health, livelihoods, and safety as climate risks increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond physical destruction, one of the greatest dangers of disasters is uncertainty‚Äîthe fear of facing crisis alone, not knowing where to turn, whom to trust, or how to find help. Disasters fracture communities and leave individuals isolated just when support matters most.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Georgia alone, Atlanta now experiences nearly <strong>six more extreme heat days each year</strong> than in the 1960s (<a href="https://www.cakex.org/sites/default/files/documents/Climate%20change%20vulnerability%20assessment%20in%20Georgia.pdf" target="_blank">Climate Vulnerability Assessment in Georgia</a>), while urban flooding events have nearly tripled since the 1980s (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/" target="_blank">NOAA Billion-Dollar Disasters</a>). Vulnerable communities‚Äîlow-income, minority, immigrant‚Äîbear the brunt of these crises, often lacking access to clear, timely, and actionable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>DisasterConnect exists to ensure no one faces disaster alone simply because they don‚Äôt know who can help.</strong> We aim to replace fear and confusion with clarity, connection, and hope.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>üéØ Who We Serve</h2>
    <p>
      DisasterConnect is built for <strong>any community facing a double burden:</strong> high climate risks and deep social or economic vulnerability. This includes neighborhoods grappling with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low income and limited resources to prepare or recover from disasters</li>
      <li>Language barriers and gaps in digital literacy</li>
      <li>Historic underinvestment in infrastructure and emergency services</li>
      <li>Housing and energy insecurity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While our <strong>pilot project begins in Georgia</strong>, DisasterConnect is designed to serve communities worldwide. Our vision is universal resilience‚Äîwhere no one is left behind.
    </p>

    <h2>üåê How DisasterConnect Works</h2>
    <p>
      DisasterConnect is <strong>not just a list of agencies.</strong> It‚Äôs an AI-powered network analysis and mapping platform inspired by tools like <strong>Kumu</strong> and modern GIS systems. Instead of forcing people to sift through dozens of websites and PDFs, DisasterConnect builds a single interactive map revealing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which agencies are responsible for specific disaster services</li>
      <li>How different agencies connect and coordinate</li>
      <li>Where critical resources like shelters and cooling centers are located</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It bridges the gap between complex government data and the real-life questions people ask during emergencies: Who can help me? How do I reach them? What resources are available in my neighborhood?
    </p>

    <h2>üí° Why DisasterConnect is Different</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not just a directory‚Äîit maps <strong>relationships</strong> and coordination paths.</li>
      <li>Transforms thousands of hidden documents into one intuitive, accessible platform.</li>
      <li>Built with a focus on equity, prioritizing marginalized communities.</li>
      <li>Uses advanced AI and network science to uncover connections invisible to individuals navigating systems alone.</li>

    <h2>üåé My Story</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Shambhavi Giri. I grew up in Nepal, one of the world‚Äôs least developed countries, where I learned early how poverty, uncertainty, and climate change shape daily life. I worked long hours to afford basic needs and education while witnessing landslides, floods, and shifting monsoons. It felt deeply unfair that communities contributing almost nothing to global emissions bore the greatest consequences.
    </p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Education became my mission. Driven to create change, I earned scholarships and crossed continents to study urban resilience and climate impacts at Georgia State University. But even here, I‚Äôve found the same injustices repeating: vulnerable communities, often low-income, minority, or immigrant, living on the frontlines of climate risks‚Äîyet cut off from critical information and support when disaster strikes.
    </p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      I‚Äôve seen it in Georgia: neighborhoods where heatwaves force families to choose between paying utility bills or protecting their health‚Ä¶ renters whose homes flood because they can‚Äôt afford to leave‚Ä¶ communities speaking languages no one in emergency management seems prepared to understand. Even my university sits in an area identified as disadvantaged due to historic underinvestment and social vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
      DisasterConnect is my response. It‚Äôs my mission to ensure people everywhere‚Äîwhether in Nepal, Georgia, or anywhere‚Äînever face disaster alone simply because systems are too complex or inaccessible. I believe information isn‚Äôt a privilege; it‚Äôs a human right, especially during crises.

    <h2>üöÄ Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      DisasterConnect is currently in early development. We‚Äôre actively working on our prototype and seeking partners, technical collaborators, and funding to pilot our platform in Georgia. Our goal is to create a model scalable worldwide, ensuring equitable disaster resilience for all communities.
