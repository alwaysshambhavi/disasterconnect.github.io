  <h1>DisasterConnect</h1>

  <p>
    Climate disasters are escalating worldwide — more frequent, more intense, and often hitting hardest in communities with the fewest resources. From deadly heatwaves to urban flooding, these crises aren’t just weather events; they’re emergencies that expose and deepen social inequalities. <strong>DisasterConnect</strong> was born to ensure no community is left in the dark when disaster strikes.
  </p>

  <h2>🌎Why DisasterConnect Matters</h2>

  <p>
    In Georgia and across the U.S., climate risks are rising fast. Atlanta now experiences nearly <strong>six more extreme heat days each year</strong> than in the 1960s, driven by both climate change and urban heat island effects (<a href="https://www.cakex.org/sites/default/files/documents/Climate%20change%20vulnerability%20assessment%20in%20Georgia.pdf" target="_blank">Climate Vulnerability Assessment in Georgia</a>). Heatwaves are lasting longer, increasing by about <strong>2.9 days per decade</strong> since 1961 (<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2024/07/29/metro-atlanta-heat-waves-are-becoming-longer-and-more-frequent" target="_blank">Axios Atlanta</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Urban flooding has surged too. Georgia averaged about <strong>3 billion-dollar disasters per year</strong> between 1980 and 2020, but in the last five years, that number has nearly tripled to almost <strong>10 major events annually</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/" target="_blank">NOAA Billion-Dollar Weather Disasters</a>). In metro Atlanta, researchers documented rapid increases in floodplain exposure between 1990 and 2010 (<a href="https://chubasco.niu.edu/pubs/Ferguson%20and%20Ashley%202017%20-%20NH.pdf" target="_blank">Northern Illinois University Study</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The burden of these disasters falls most heavily on communities already struggling: neighborhoods where families live paycheck to paycheck, lack air conditioning, speak limited English, or have low digital literacy. A 2024 report found that heat stress disproportionately affects transit riders in Atlanta, who are predominantly Black and lower-income, highlighting how systemic inequities magnify climate risks.
  </p>

  <h2>🎯 Who We Serve</h2>

  <p>
    DisasterConnect is built for <strong>any community facing a double burden</strong>: high climate risks and social or economic vulnerability. This includes neighborhoods dealing with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low income and limited resources to prepare or recover from disasters</li>
    <li>Language barriers and digital literacy gaps</li>
    <li>Historic underinvestment in infrastructure and emergency services</li>
    <li>Housing and energy insecurity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    While our <strong>pilot project begins in Georgia</strong> — where we live and study — DisasterConnect is designed to serve <strong>vulnerable communities anywhere in the U.S. or globally</strong>. Our goal is universal: to ensure that no one, anywhere, faces a disaster alone simply because they don’t know who to turn to for help.
  </p>

  <h2>🌐 How DisasterConnect Works</h2>

  <p>
    DisasterConnect is <strong>not just a document repository.</strong> It’s a powerful AI-driven network analysis and mapping platform inspired by tools like <strong>Kumu</strong> for social network analysis and advanced GIS systems used in urban planning. Our goal is to transform fragmented disaster response information into an interactive, accessible, and plain-language platform that anyone can use.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of forcing residents to dig through dozens of government websites or lengthy PDFs, DisasterConnect creates an intuitive map showing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which agencies and organizations are responsible for specific disaster services</li>
    <li>How different agencies connect and coordinate</li>
    <li>Where critical resources like cooling centers, shelters, and relief services are physically located</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We’re building DisasterConnect to bridge the gap between <strong>technical government data and the real-life questions people have in emergencies:</strong> Who can help me right now? How do I contact them? What resources are available in my neighborhood?
  </p>

  <h2>🔗 Our Data Pipeline</h2>

  <p>
    DisasterConnect’s technology pipeline includes:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We automatically crawl official government websites, emergency plans, policy documents, and open data portals from agencies like FEMA, NOAA, and local governments.</li>
    <li><strong>AI/NLP Analysis:</strong> We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract critical details from complex documents, identifying:
      <ul>
        <li>Agency names and roles</li>
        <li>Types of services offered (e.g. cooling centers, shelters, flood relief)</li>
        <li>Geographic areas of responsibility</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge Graph:</strong> We store this data in a graph database that captures relationships between agencies, services, and locations. This allows for powerful, question-based searches like:
      <ul>
        <li>“Who operates cooling centers in my county?”</li>
        <li>“Which agencies coordinate flood relief in my neighborhood?”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Visualization:</strong> We transform these connections into:
      <ul>
        <li>Network maps showing relationships between actors (like social network diagrams)</li>
        <li>GIS maps pinpointing critical infrastructure and services</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>User-Centric Interface:</strong> We translate complex jargon into clear, plain-language insights, with future plans for multilingual support to reach diverse communities.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>💡 Why DisasterConnect is Different</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>It’s not just a directory — it’s a network analysis tool revealing <strong>how agencies and services connect</strong>.</li>
    <li>It turns thousands of hidden government documents into a single, searchable, user-friendly map.</li>
    <li>It’s built from the ground up for <strong>equity and climate resilience</strong>, prioritizing marginalized and vulnerable communities.</li>
    <li>It uses advanced AI and network science to uncover insights impossible for individuals to piece together manually.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌎 My Story</h2>

  <p>
    My name is [Your Name]. I grew up in Nepal, one of the world’s least developed countries, working overtime to afford basic needs and scholarships while witnessing climate disasters that our country did almost nothing to cause. Seeking solutions, I came to the U.S. on scholarship to study urban resilience at Georgia State University.
  </p>

  <p>
    But here, too, I found communities facing the same double burden: high climate risks and systemic social disadvantage. I’ve seen neighborhoods in Georgia where heatwaves force families to choose between health and paying utility bills, where renters lose homes to floods, and where language barriers leave people isolated in crises.
  </p>

  <p>
    DisasterConnect is my response to these injustices. It’s my mission to ensure that people everywhere — in Nepal, Georgia, or anywhere — never stand alone in a disaster simply because they don’t know who can help. I believe information is not a privilege — it’s a human right, especially in times of crisis.
  </p>

  <h2>🚀 Current Status</h2>

  <p>
    DisasterConnect is currently in its early development phase. We’re working on our first prototype and seeking partners, technical collaborators, and funding to pilot our platform in Georgia as a model for communities everywhere.
